        <h2>What is Audio Visualization?</h2>
        <p class="text"> Music visualization is the electronic generation of shapes and images based on music, which
          allows music listeners to "see" the songs to which they are listening. The primary tool to create shapes and
          images through music visualization is computer software which is designed to capture data from a music audio
          file. For example, it gathers information about frequencies and volume levels, both of which can be
          represented numerically. The computer software then translates the data into a specific hue on a predefined
          color spectrum. It also assigns the data a spatial point using X and Y axes. </p>

        <h2> The History of Audio Visualisation</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The first electronic music visualizer was the <em>Atari Video Music</em> introduced by Atari Inc. in 1976,
          and
          designed by the initiator of the home version of Pong, Robert Brown. The idea was to create a visual
          exploration that could be implemented into a Hi-Fi stereo system. In the United Kingdom music visualization
          was first pioneered by Fred Judd.
          For PC/DOS one of the first modern music visualization programs was the open-source, multi-platform Cthugha
          in 1993. In the 1990s the emerging demo and tracker music scene pioneered the real-time technics for music
          visualization on the PC platform; resulting examples are Cubic player (1994), Inertia Player (1995) or in
          general their real-time generated Demos.
          Some of the more recent applications such as Luminant Music (2017), produce visualization in real time and
          render to a full-3D environment.
          With the increasing popularity of virtual reality, several start ups have begun working on music
          visualization although reception has been mixed with one informal poll finding that only 33% of respondents
          were
          interested in music visualization for VR.
